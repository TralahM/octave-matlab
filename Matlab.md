### Types of variables
* Scalars
* Vectors
* Matrices

```matlab
x=5
size(x)
v=[1,2,3];
v=[1 2 3];
clear
A=[1 3; 3 4];
size(A)
v=v' % to column vector transpose
% use semicolon separation
v=[1;2;3;4]
% indexing
% A(i,j) row col
% rows of vectors
A(1,:) % first row of A
A(:,2) % second col of A
A(:,:)
A=[1 2 3 4;4 3 2 6;54 34 2 1;43 5 67 7 3;1 5 76 3]
A(2:3,2:3)
w=1:10
