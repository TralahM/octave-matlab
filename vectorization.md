# Vectorizing Parameters for faster and more efficient Computations
Turning parameters into vectors allows you to take advantage of
scientific computing libraries' implementation of vector operations rather than redefining
the functions.
e.g in *gradient descent* and *linear regression* problems.

This allows your code to run more efficiently and write less code to solve your problem
